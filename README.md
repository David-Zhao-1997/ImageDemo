# SatImgVwr

This project is mainly aimed for detecting presence of "Enteromorpha" in a satellite image.

Only in a specific format, your image can be processed, specificly the ones captured by ZiYuan3, which come with an HDR description file.

## Usage

Run the main class `graphics.ui.ImageClusterLauncher`.

An user interface will pop up and ask you to select your image file.
